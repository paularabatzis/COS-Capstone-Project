JobGrader Android Application

This project to date is still in the design and research phase. While I have spent some time implementing my design into AndroidStudio, I will need to spend more time on that in the coming weeks to finalize what I have and gather input from the user. I have found a web api for scraping websites (webharvy), and plan to specifically use it to scrape data from GlassDoor.com, LinkedIn.com, and possibly any government websites that I can find with usable public data for my project. I will scrape data as needed and then place it in a database, accessible on demand by my application. Once the database is set up, all I will need to do is access it based on the input from each user in the app. Although since I am a bit behind, I will need to put in work over the next month to ensure that I have a functioning prototype for presentation in early December. I've only uploaded the MainActivity.java file so far because the entire project folder is too large to upload, even if compressed. I will continue to update this file as well as any other files as I go about completing this project over the next month.
