JobGrader Android Application

This project to date is still in the design and research phase. While I have spent some time implementing my design into AndroidStudio, I will need to spend more time on that in the coming weeks to finalize what I have and gather input from the user. I have found a web api for scraping websites, and plan to specifically use it to scrape data from GlassDoor.com, LinkedIn.com, and possibly any government websites that I can find with usable public data for my project. Although since I am a bit behind, I will need to put in work over the next month to ensure that I have a functioning prototype for presentation in early December.
